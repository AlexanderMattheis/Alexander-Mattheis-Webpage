# BITCORN
This repository contains a website I've formerly created to test out the Ember Framework
and modern webpage implementations. It includes a full implemented pagination
and a search bar which can be used to find tagged objects on my website.
The idea is to create a platform for interactive, free video-tutorials.

On that website you can also download creations like vector-graphics,
fonts and textures. Everything is free, so you have not to pay any licence fees. 
Even you have not to mention the author's name because everything 
except the logos were released under the [CC0 licence](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).

**Hint:** You need [Ember](https://www.emberjs.com/) to transpile and work with the page.
