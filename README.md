# Alexander Mattheis Webpage
This repository contains my currently fictitious website to test out the Ember Framework
and modern webpage implementation. It includes a full implemented pagination
and a search bar which can be used to find tagged objects on my website.

On that website you can download my creations like vector-graphics,
fonts and textures I've created by myself. Everything is free,
so you have not to pay any licence fees. Even you have not
to mention my name because I've released everything 
except my logo under the [CC0 licence](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).

**Hint:** You need [Ember](https://www.emberjs.com/) to transpile and work with the page.
