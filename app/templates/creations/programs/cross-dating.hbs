    The correct dates of wood pieces can be determined by annual rings.
    Therefore, one can just measure the widths or maximum densities of individual rings
    and then shift them in a chronology with known dates to determine the exact calendar year.
    But such established approaches do not work well with short pieces,
    i.e. with wood pieces containing only a few annual rings.
    This new approach, however, is different.
    It has been shown that it can accurately determine the date for even shorter wood pieces correctly.
    Therefore, it uses series of densities within a ring.
    By this it becomes one of the most accurate, existing approaches in dendrochronology, today!
