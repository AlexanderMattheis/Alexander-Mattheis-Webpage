    I'm kidding, I have a palace.
    No, not really. So, if you like that kind of humor
    paired with many computer science jokes,
    you will <em>&#x2764;</em> my page.

    What is this page about? It's a website for modern, interactive video tutorials.
    Mainly for computer science, but also maths and other sciences.
    Interactive means in this case, you watch a cool video or presentation
    and can play afterwards with the presented algorithm on my website.
    Additionally, you can also download free
    <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/deed.de" target="_blank">CC0-licence</a>
    stuff and get creative programming ideas in my creations section.
    Is this not cool?
